##Summary
The aim of this Thesis was using Natural User Interfaces for robotic arm model control. This study was an attempt to adapt existing solutions from entertainment market and to verify the possibility of their use in controling movement of anthropomorphically built arm. During the work the software was created, that will give opportunity to present effects of analysis and test its results in practice . In the longer term, the resulting source code will be able to provide the foundation for the software library, which will allow for the possibility of easy implementation of cooperation between the device and the depth camera, which will be acting here as a visual system with more advanced capabilities than standard computer vision because of the ability to measure the distance between the observed object and the camera .

During the tests Kinect for Xbox 360 from Microsoft was used. Device, which, despite low economic cost, has acceptable capabilities and allows for a relatively accurate distance measurement.

In order to facilitate testing of this solutions, instead of a physical device, computer model, made in CAD / CAE software, was used. This model was also created during writing the thesis.

The project is only a concept, and its purpose is to create a working prototype solutions, as well as learning the necessary technology, test their implementation, and verify the possibility of using this combination in engineering practice experimentally. Therefore, sufficient precision was not imposed, which is necessary to obtain a workflow. However, there were tries to acquire the most satisfacting results and tests if consumer depth camera and Natural User Interfaces usage can possibly be used in places where manual control is impossible, so are GUI or CLI interfaces.
